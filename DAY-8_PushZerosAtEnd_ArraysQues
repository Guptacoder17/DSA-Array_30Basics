Problem statement
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You have been required to push all the zeros that are present in the array/list to the end of it. Also, make sure to maintain the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note:
Change in the input array/list itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.

You need to do this in one scan of array only. Don't use extra space.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
7
2 0 0 1 3 0 0
Sample Output 1:
2 1 3 0 0 0 0
 Explanation for the Sample Input 1 :
All the zeros have been pushed towards the end of the array/list. Another important fact is that the order of the non-zero elements have been maintained as they appear in the input array/list.
Sample Input 2:
2
5
0 3 0 2 0
5
9 0 0 8 2

SOLUTION:
public class Solution {  

    public static void pushZerosAtEnd(int[] arr) {
    	int nonzero = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(arr[i] !=0){
                int temp =arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[nonzero];
                arr[nonzero] = temp;
                nonzero++;

            }
        }
    }

}
